## Features

- **Column-based tiling** - Niri-inspired layout engine that automatically arranges windows in columns
- **Multiple workspaces** - Create and manage virtual workspaces with per-monitor assignment
- **40+ keyboard shortcuts** - Navigate, move, and resize windows efficiently (all customizable)
- **App rules** - Configure per-application behavior (floating, workspace assignment, minimum size)
- **Window borders** - Visual indicator for the focused window
- **Fuzzy finder** - Press `Option + Space` to search through all windows and navigate directly to them
- **Window tabs** - Group multiple windows into tabbed containers for better organization
- **Workspace bar** - Menu bar widget with sorted app icons; click any icon to navigate to that window
- **Focus follows mouse** - Optionally focus windows when hovering over them

## Known Limitations

- **Multi-monitor support** - Not fully tested (developer lacks multi-monitor setup)
- **Gestures/Trackpad** - Magic Mouse and trackpad gestures are untested (no hardware available for testing)

## Requirements
